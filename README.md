# 20Percent

The idea behing a 20% project is thay you spend 20% of you time working towards a goal. 
It could be a project you enjoy, or leaning a new language, but it fosters innovtion and acheivement.
For my 20% prject, I have choosen to create a calculator that could be used to test the quality of a water sample. 
Anyone who lives near or owns a body of water who wants to improve its quality and health can use my product. 
It is important to creating a clean ecosystem and helping marine life have better health.
