# 20Percent

Overview:
The idea behing a 20% project is thay you spend 20% of you time working towards a goal. It could be a project you enjoy, or leaning a new language, but it fosters innovtion and acheivement. For my 20% prject, I have choosen to create a calculator that could be used to test the quality of a water sample. Anyone who lives near or owns a body of water who wants to improve its quality and health can use my product. It is important to creating a clean ecosystem and helping marine life have better health.

Recipe Project:
In order to test functions and get comfortable with HTML, I created a fake recipe project that made virtual pasta. I learned how to link things to html, add photos, and see how the code looks on the website. The biggest thing I learned form the practive recipe was learning how to use buttons and the style class. I found it very helpful when creating my actual websote because I already knew a little of what I was doing.

Water Quality Input:
The water quality input file is where I prompt the user and read in their input. I prompt the user with text boxes and they enter the values of aspects that determine water quality and I read in their data to manipulate later in my code. This is the first page the user will see till they are redirected to links that apply to their data.

Water Quality:
This is where I code the different if statements and conditions of each of the characteristics to print likns and helpo the user. I take in the data and determine is it is below, above, or average and print links to help the condition.

User:
In order to run the code, you must download the files into a text reader. From there the user only has to click on the HTML file that opens up a search browser. The user must select boxes and press the submit button to get results from the water quality calculator.
